# Dark GeoGebra

![Dark GeoGebra - Flat Dark Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endorh/dark-geogebra/images/flat-dark-demo.png)

This is a fork from [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) (https://www.geogebra.org/). The original code from this
project can be found at the official
[GeoGebra mirror repository](https://github.com/geogebra/geogebra) on GitHub.

This fork was created in order to add the following features to the classic Desktop version
of GeoGebra:

- Dark Theme support (using [FlatLaf](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf), and inverting colors from objects/images/icons)
- Java version updated to Java 17 (which means correct scaling on Hi-DPI devices)
- Mnemonics on menus and dialogs (assigned automatically)
- Infinite view dragging (mouse is warped within the view's bounds, like in Blender)
- Hotkey to focus algebraic input bar (F5)

These features were developed purely for my own personal use, as the GeoGebra developers
seem to not have any plans to add them in the near future (in particular, the
[dark theme](https://help.geogebra.org/topic/black-theme-inverse-to-the-default)).
Unfortunately, some people do not consider a dark theme feature an accessibility
requirement for any user interface.

The implementation of these features focuses exclusively on the `desktop`
module and makes no effort to support them in other platforms neither now
nor in the future.

I have made no effort in updating nor running any tests included in the code,
nor any module not required by the `desktop` module.

You may use this fork at your own risk, for non-commercial purposes, and without any
official support from GeoGebra GmbH (nor me). I have decided to share this fork in the
hope that it may be useful to someone in my same situation and for no other purpose.

I do not plan to actively maintain this repository, but I may (or may not) be able
to help you with problems getting it to work if you create an issue.

To learn more on development of GeoGebra (including suggested compilation
steps) please visit https://dev.geogebra.org/, and the official
[GeoGebra mirror repository](https://github.com/geogebra/geogebra) on GitHub.

## Setup the development environment

* Open IntelliJ. If you don't have IntelliJ on your computer yet
  then you can download and install it from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
* In the menu select `File/New/Project from Version Control/Git`
* In the new window add the following path: `https://github.com/endorh/dark-geogebra.git`
* Click on `Checkout`, select your preferred destination folder, select Java 17 as the SDK,
  click on OK and waitâ€¦
* After the project is checked out, select the root folder of the project,
  open the Run Anything tool (Double Ctrl) and run the following command:
  `./gradlew :desktop:run`, as explained below
* After a few minutes the Desktop UI will appear. Note that compiling GeoGebra requires
  the download of a few dependencies. The first compilation will take considerably longer
  as all necessary modules will need to be compiled. Go drink a coffee, take a walk, read
  a book... you get it.

## Running the desktop version (Classic 5)
To start the desktop version from command line, run

```
./gradlew :desktop:run
```
You can also run `./gradlew :desktop:tasks` to list other options.

If you're using IntelliJ (which you should), you may also pick the
`desktop/application/run` task from the Gradle Tool Window, or create a
run configuration for it. 

## Generating a desktop installer for your platform
To generate a desktop installer for the desktop version, run the following command
on the desired platform (Windows, Linux or macOS) (installers can only be generated
on their target platforms):

```
./gradlew :desktop:jpackage
```
The generated installers will be located within the `desktop/build/jpackage` directory.

If you're using IntelliJ (which you should), you may also pick the `desktop/build/jpackage`
task from the Gradle Tool Window.

## Light Theme
If you despise your eye health so much, yes, you can still use the light theme.
Dark GeoGebra provides a flat version of the light theme, as well as the classic
themes from GeoGebra.
